PROBLEM STATEMENT:

        Many people struggle with expressing themselves through poetry due to the complexities of language and the creative process involved. Moreover, not everyone has the time or inspiration to craft meaningful poems. There is a need for a tool that can assist individuals in generating poetic verses on various topics without the need for extensive poetic knowledge or creativity.
        Description:
        The "AI-based Poetry Generator" is a project that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to create poetry. It works by analyzing patterns in existing poetry and using that knowledge to generate new poems automatically. Users can input prompts or themes, and the AI will produce original poems based on those inputs. This project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of AI in creative writing and provide users with unique and personalized poetry.
